# Hi, I'm James 👋  
*(Aussie by origin, recruiter by trade, rowing enthusiast / hobby DJ by questionable life choices.)*

Born and raised in Geelong, I once pursued a career as a "professional" rower —  
**professional** in the sense that I trained like hell and got paid like… well, let’s not talk about it.

After realising life existed beyond early mornings on the water, I joined a 50-person rowing boat company where my job title was roughly:  
**"Sales / Marketing / Deliveries / Also Possibly some assembly."**  
The apple didn’t fall far from the boat, but it did start drifting toward tech.

Somewhere between boat deliveries and boat slinging, I also dabbled as a DJ.  
Not Ibiza-residency level… more *wedding DJ with a fog machine I borrowed from my housemate* vibes.  
Still counts. People danced.

Eventually, I leaned into my tech obsession (with a side of dusty university code) and jumped into recruitment — specifically product engineers for early-stage startups. That stuck.

Now based in **Vigo, Spain** with my wife and two boys, I get to:
- 🚀 Work with ambitious startups  
- 🧠 Match smart engineers with problems worth solving  
- 🎙️ Ask clever questions on [What Next Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@WhatNextDev), our podcast where Matthew Sinclair gives actual good advice, and I mostly nod

I've been in Spain for over 2 years.  
My Spanish is progressing slowly but steadily — like a snail on a scenic route.

💌 **Don’t be afraid to say hi** — or give me feedback on my horrible code. I can take it (mostly).
