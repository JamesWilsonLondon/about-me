# 🧠 Nonsense or Startup?

Welcome to **Nonsense or Startup?** – a delightfully ridiculous guessing game where you decide if a business idea is a real startup or pure nonsense.

> “An AI that translates meows into Shakespearean English.”  
> Real or nonsense? You decide.

## 🎮 How it Works

Each time you load the page, you’ll see a new startup idea.  
Click **“Startup”** if you think it’s a legit company, or **“Nonsense”** if it’s something a raccoon dreamed up on a whiteboard.

You’ll get instant feedback, then move on to the next idea.
