      <p><strong>> Hi, I'm James 👋</strong></p>
      <p>(Aussie by origin, recruiter by trade, rowing enthusiast / hobby DJ by questionable life choices.)</p>

      <p>
        Born and raised in Geelong, I once pursued a career as a "professional" rower —  
        professional in the sense that I trained like hell and got paid like… well, let’s not talk about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After realising life existed beyond early mornings on the water, I joined a 50-person rowing boat company where my job title was roughly:<br>
        "Sales / Marketing / Deliveries / Also Possibly some assembly."<br>
        The apple didn’t fall far from the boat, but it did start drifting toward tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        Somewhere between boat deliveries and boat slinging, I also dabbled as a DJ.<br>
        Not Ibiza-residency level… more wedding DJ with a fog machine I borrowed from my housemate vibes.<br>
        Still counts. People danced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, I leaned into my tech obsession (with a side of dusty university code) and jumped into recruitment — specifically product engineers for early-stage startups. That stuck.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now based in Vigo, Spain with my wife and two boys, I get to:
        <ul>
          <li>🚀 Work with ambitious startups</li>
          <li>🧠 Match smart engineers with problems worth solving</li>
          <li>🎙️ Ask clever questions on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WhatNextDev" target="_blank">What Next Dev</a>, our podcast where Matthew Sinclair gives actual good advice, and I mostly nod</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been in Spain for over 2 years.  
        My Spanish is progressing slowly but steadily — like a snail on a scenic route.
      </p>

      <p>
        💌 Don’t be afraid to say hi — or give me feedback on my horrible code. I can take it (mostly).<br>
        🎧 All DJ residency enquiries can go directly to my manager (aka me):
