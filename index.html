  <h1>Hi, I'm James 👋</h1>
  <p>(Aussie by origin, recruiter by trade, rowing enthusiast / hobby DJ by questionable life choices.)</p>

  <p>
    Born and raised in Geelong, I once pursued a career as a "professional" rower—
    <br>
    professional in the sense that I trained like hell and got paid like… well, let’s not talk about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    After realising life existed beyond early mornings on the water, I joined a 50-person rowing boat company where my job title was roughly:<br>
    "Sales / Marketing / Deliveries / Also Possibly some assembly."<br>
    The apple didn’t fall far from the boat, but it did start drifting toward tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    Somewhere between boat deliveries and boat slinging, I also dabbled as a DJ.<br>
    Not Ibiza-residency level… more wedding DJ with a fog machine I borrowed from my housemate vibes.<br>
    Still counts. People danced.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, I leaned into my tech obsession (with a side of dusty university code) and jumped into recruitment—specifically product engineers for early-stage startups. That stuck.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now based in Vigo, Spain with my wife and two boys, I get to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>🚀 Work with ambitious startups</li>
    <li>🧠 Match smart engineers with problems worth solving</li>
    <li>🎙️ Ask clever questions on <strong>What Next Dev</strong>, our podcast where Matthew Sinclair gives actual good advice, and I mostly nod</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I’ve been in Spain for over 2 years. My Spanish is progressing slowly but steadily, like a snail on a scenic route.</p>

  <p>
    💌 Don’t be afraid to say hi — or give me feedback on my horrible code. I can take it (mostly).<br>
    🎧 All DJ residency enquiries can go directly to my manager (aka me): <a href="mailto:jameswilson11@gmail.com">jameswilson11@gmail.com</a>
